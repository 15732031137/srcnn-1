# Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network

We have implemented [SRCNN], [FSRCNN] and [ESPCN] in [Keras] with [TensorFlow] backend.

[SRCNN]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092
[FSRCNN]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00367
[ESPCN]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05158
[Keras]: https://github.com/fchollet/keras
[TensorFlow]: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow

## Installation

A Python package `toolbox` is developed to facilitate our experiments. You need to install it to reproduce our experiments. The easiest way to install is
 
```bash
pip install -e .
```

For other situations, see this more detailed [installation instructions](install/README.md).
