# Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network

This is our course project to reproduce and try to improve the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) from the paper [Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092).

## Installation

A Python package `toolbox` is developed to facilitate our experiments. You need to install it to reproduce our experiments. The easiest way to install is
 
```bash
pip install -e .
```

For other situations, see this more detailed [installation instructions](install/README.md).
