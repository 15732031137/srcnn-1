# Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network

This is our course project to reproduce and try to improve the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) from the paper [Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092).

## Installation

Reusable general codes are kept in the `toolbox` Python package. To install it, run

```bash
pip install -e .
```
